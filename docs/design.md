# Design decisions vs. Go

Rust and Go differ. This project keeps behavior similar to
[`oapi-codegen`](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen), but some design
choices are different.

## Server: native async trait, axum only

- **Go:** Many framework targets from one plain interface.
- **Rust:** One `trait Api` with native async fn in traits, for axum 0.8.
- **Why:** Stable Rust supports async traits directly. One framework keeps
  output clear and avoids extra macro dependencies.

There is one structured server mode. There is no unstructured handler mode.

## Typed status-code response enums

- **Go:** Per-status structs or context returns.
- **Rust:** One `enum <Op>Response` per operation, with one variant per status.

The same enum is the server response (`IntoResponse`) and the client success
type. New status codes require explicit match updates.

## Token-based generation, not templates

- **Go:** `text/template`, user override support.
- **Rust:** Build `TokenStream` with `quote!`, parse with `syn::File`, and
  format with `prettyplease`.

## Blocking `reqwest` client

The client returns `Result<<Op>Response, ClientError>`.
The default mode is blocking. It does not force an async runtime.

## Derive HTTP status semantics

Status codes come from `StatusCode` types in `http`, `axum`, and `reqwest`.
The project does not keep a separate manual status table.

## Direction-aware serde derives

Generated models derive only the serde traits they need.
Server-only response models derive `Serialize`.
Server-only request models derive `Deserialize`.
When both directions are needed, models derive both.

This avoids impossible trait bounds on reused `x-rust-type` targets.

## Vendor extensions

Supported keys:

- `x-rust-type`
- `x-rust-name`
- `x-rust-serde-skip`
- Compatibility keys: `x-omitempty`, `x-order`, `x-deprecated-reason`,
  `x-enum-varnames`, `x-enumNames`

`x-go-*` keys are accepted but ignored.

## Combined output at the crate root

Generated models, per-operation types, server interfaces, and client interfaces
are emitted at the crate root in one file.

If a generated per-operation type name conflicts with a component model name,
generation fails. Use `x-rust-name` or `response-type-suffix` to resolve it.

## OpenAPI 3.0

The generator reads OpenAPI 3.0 documents through the `openapiv3` crate.

## Config compatibility

YAML config keys mirror `oapi-codegen`.
Unknown keys are ignored.

## Explicit invocation

- **Go:** A bare command can generate output from defaults.
- **Rust:** You must pass `--config-file`. The config must enable at least one
  artifact. You must set output with `--output-file` or config `output:`.

If generation produces no code, the tool fails with guidance.
